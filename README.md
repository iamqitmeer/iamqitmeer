### Front-end Web Developer | Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Next.js | Looking for Internship

---

## Summary

Hi, I’m Qitmeer. I’m currently studying Full Stack Web and Mobile App Development at Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT). I have a big passion for technology and enjoy creating websites and mobile apps that are useful and easy to use. Right now, I focus on front-end development. This means I use tools like Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Next.js to build websites that look good and work well for users.

As a beginner, I am very eager to get real-world experience to improve my skills. My classes and personal projects have taught me a lot about how to build modern websites. I am especially interested in learning more about back-end development and mobile app development. I also want to become skilled in the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, to become a well-rounded developer.

I am actively looking for an internship where I can work with experienced professionals, learn new things, and apply what I have learned. I hope to find a place that encourages growth, learning, and creativity. If you are looking for a motivated and eager-to-learn developer, I would love to connect with you and discuss how I can contribute to your team.
